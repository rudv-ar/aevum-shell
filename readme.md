# Aevum Shell 

## what is aevum

aevum is a personal bspwm shell for Arch Linux. It is not a desktop environment, not a framework, and not meant to be generic. It is a tightly configured, opinionated rice built around a specific workflow — keyboard-driven, minimal, fast, and visually deliberate. I ported this from my previous project - [rudv-shell-1.0](https://github.com/rudv-ar/rudv-shell-1.0).

The name comes from the Latin *aevum* — meaning age or era. A small nod to the `revolution-18` idea this started from.

## setup

**1. clone**

```
git clone https://github.com/yourname/aevum ~/.config/aevum
cd ~/.config/aevum
git switch main
```

**2. install deps**

```
bash ~/.config/aevum/install/deps.sh
```

Launches an interactive menu. Run option 1 first (repo + keyring), then 4 (install everything). Requires `yay` for AUR packages.

**3. link configs**

```
bash ~/.config/aevum/install/linker.sh add-all
```

Symlinks everything from `aevum/config/` into `~/.config/`. Safe to rerun — real directories get purged and relinked, existing symlinks are left alone unless you pass `-f`.


## branch model

| branch | purpose |
|---|---|
| `main` | stable, daily-driver config |
| `dev` | active development, experimental changes |
| `stable` | slow releasing, major versions |

Switching branches live-switches your entire config instantly since everything is symlinked into the source tree. So if you want to try different versions of this shell, just git switch to the branch via the following commands and optionally - ctrl + shift + r to hot reload everything. 

```
git switch main   # stable rolling
git switch dev    # experimental
git switch stable # stable - slow releasing
```

## tools

**deps.sh** — manages dependencies

```
deps install all
deps install pacman / yay
deps install <pkg> -f
deps verify all
deps setup keyring
deps setup keyring -r
```

**linker.sh** — manages symlinks

```
linker add <app> [-f]
linker remove <app> [-f]
linker verify <app> [-f]
linker add-all [-f]
linker verify-all [-f]
```


## hardware target

Built on constrained hardware — Intel GMA 900 (i915, GLES2 only), 2GB DDR2, BIOS system. All choices are made with this in mind. No Wayland. No heavy compositing tricks. No GPU-dependent effects. So, from my opinion, this should work for any age old processor and hardware. 


## status

early dev. structure is stable, configs are being migrated and tuned. not ready for anyone else to use completely - but only working stuffs are pushed - so you can try it.

## for developers 

While switching the git branches in the ~/.config/aevum, the picom compositor and quickshell may apply changes immeditately. If you feel that the UI is somewhat misalligned, either of the following should fix it : 

```bash
pkill qs && ~/.config/bspwm/widgets/quickshell/launch.sh & 
# or, reload the wm 
hotkey : press ctrl + shift + r

```
